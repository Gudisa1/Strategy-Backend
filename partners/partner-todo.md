# âœ… Partner Management API â€“ TODO

## 1. **Models & Migrations**

* [ ] Define `Partner` model.
* [ ] Define `PartnerProfile` (One-to-One with Partner).
* [ ] Define `PartnerDocuments` (uploads).
* [ ] Define `StatusHistory`.
* [ ] Define `RiskLevelHistory`.
* [ ] Define `PartnerDepartments` (M\:N link table).
* [ ] Run migrations & verify DB schema.

---

## 2. **Serializers**

* [ ] Create `PartnerSerializer` (basic partner info).
* [ ] Create `PartnerProfileSerializer` (KYC/due diligence).
* [ ] Create `PartnerDocumentsSerializer`.
* [ ] Create `StatusHistorySerializer`.
* [ ] Create `RiskLevelHistorySerializer`.
* [ ] Nested serializers for retrieving partner with profile/documents.

---

## 3. **Views / Endpoints**

(Use DRF ViewSets / APIViews with proper permissions)

* **Partner**

  * [ ] `POST /api/partners/` â†’ Create new partner (requires authenticated user).
  * [ ] `GET /api/partners/` â†’ List all partners (filters: type, status, risk\_level).
  * [ ] `GET /api/partners/{id}/` â†’ Retrieve partner details.

  * [ ] `DELETE /api/partners/{id}/` â†’ Soft-delete / deactivate partner.


  <!-- Done til this Point -->

  * [ ] `POST /api/partners/{id}/profile/` â†’ Create profile (if not exists).
  * [ ] `GET /api/partners/{id}/profile/` â†’ Retrieve profile.
  * [ ] `PUT/PATCH /api/partners/{id}/profile/` â†’ Update profile.

* **Partner Documents**

  * [ ] `POST /api/partners/{id}/documents/` â†’ Upload document.

  * [ ] `GET /api/partners/{id}/departments/` â†’ List assigned departments.
  * [ ] `DELETE /api/partners/{id}/departments/{dep_id}/` â†’ Unassign.

---

## 4. **Permissions & Access**

* [ ] Ensure **access control** integrates with your existing auth.
* [ ] Example rules:

  * Only Admins can approve/blacklist.
  * Normal staff can onboard but not delete.
  * Departments can only view partners assigned to them.

---

## 5. **Testing with Postman**

* [ ] Create a **Partner Collection** in Postman.
* [ ] Add **environment variables** (base\_url, auth\_token, partner\_id).
* [ ] Write test requests for:

  * âœ… Create Partner â†’ store partner\_id.
  * âœ… Add Partner Profile.
  * âœ… Upload Partner Document.
  * âœ… Change Status & Check Status History.
  * âœ… Change Risk & Check Risk History.
  * âœ… Assign Department & Verify.
* [ ] Add **Postman tests** (JS assertions) for common cases:

  * Check 201 status on creation.
  * Check response body contains `id`.
  * Ensure status/risk history entries increase after change.
* [ ] Save Postman collection â†’ export/share for QA.

---

## 6. **Next Steps**

Once Partner Management APIs are stable:

* Proceed to **Partnership Projects API** (linking partners to specific projects).
* Proceed to **MOUs API** (tracking agreements, validity, compliance).

---
---
---

# ðŸ“‘ Project-Centric Design: Projects â†’ Partnerships â†’ MOUs

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. **Project Model (Foundation)**

Every collaboration starts with a **Project**.

* **Attributes**:

  * `name`
  * `description`
  * `start_date`
  * `end_date`
  * `status` (planned, active, completed, on hold)

This is the **root entity**. Everything else (partners, agreements) connects back to projects.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. **Partnership Projects API**

Defines how **partners are connected to projects**.

* **Attributes**:

  * `project` (FK â†’ Project âœ… foundation)
  * `partner` (FK â†’ Partner)
  * `role` (lead, funder, contributor, etc.)
  * `contribution` (optional: financial, in-kind, hours, etc.)
  * `start_date`
  * `end_date`
  * `status` (active, completed, withdrawn)

* **Logic**:

  * Many-to-many (a project can have many partners, a partner can join many projects).
  * Timelines define involvement periods.
  * Status tracks participation stage.

* **Use Cases**:

  * Get all partners of a project.
  * See all projects a partner is involved in.
  * Filter partners by role (e.g., "find all funders").

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. **MOUs API**

Formal **legal agreements** with partners.

* Although an MOU is mainly **between the org and a partner**, it may also **govern a specific project**.

* **Attributes**:

  * `partner` (FK â†’ Partner âœ… always linked to a partner)
  * `project` (optional FK â†’ Project âœ… if MOU is tied to a specific project)
  * `title` / `subject`
  * `mou_file` (immutable, no edits/deletes)
  * `status` (Draft, Active, Expired, Terminated)
  * `start_date`
  * `end_date`
  * `created_at` (timestamp)

* **Rules**:

  * File immutability: once uploaded, cannot be edited/deleted.
  * Versioning: new MOU = new record.
  * Status automation: auto-expire when end\_date passes.
  * Always linked to a **partner**, optionally linked to a **project**.

* **Use Cases**:

  * See all MOUs of a partner.
  * Query active/expired agreements.
  * Trace which project(s) an MOU governs.

---

## ðŸ”— Relationships Recap

* **Project** (root)

  * â†” **Partners** â†’ via **Partnership Projects API**
  * â†” **MOUs** â†’ optional legal link (agreement covering this project)

* **Partner**

  * Can appear in multiple projects.
  * Can have multiple MOUs (across time/projects).
